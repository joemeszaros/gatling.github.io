  "KLM_TITLE": "KLM User Story",
  "KLM_SUBTITLE_1": "The big picture",
  "KLM_CONTENT_1": "<p><strong>Gatling helps KLM to move from a project oriented to a continuous delivery organization</strong> by enabling the integration of load and performance testing into the continuous delivery process.</p><p>Being a <strong>developer friendly tool</strong>, that integrates well with other development tools used at KLM, Gatling was quickly adopted by developers in the product teams.</p><p>By integrating performance tests in the delivery pipeline, the teams get <strong>daily feedback on performance during a sprint</strong>, so that they can detect and solve issues early in the development process.</p>",
  "KLM_SUBTITLE_2": "The story",
  "KLM_CONTENT_2": "<p>At KLM there are <strong>several business critical web applications</strong>. The online booking tool, for instance, generates a significant amount of the airline's total revenues.</p><p><strong>Downtime or bad performance of this application can lead to unacceptable loss in revenue</strong>. Poorly performing passenger handling applications like internet check-in can lead to large queues at the airport.</p><p>Therefore all business critical applications are performance tested thoroughly before go live. The performance tests also provide input for capacity planning.</p>",
  "KLM_SUBTITLE_3": "Shorter time to market without compromising quality",
  "KLM_CONTENT_3": "<p>Over the last ten years, all performance tests were executed by a dedicated performance test team of five specialists, testing for approximately 100 go lives per year. Since 2014 KLM is transforming from a projectoriented into a continuous delivery organization.</p><p><strong>One of the goals is to shorten time to market</strong> by increasing the number of go lives,<strong>without compromising on quality</strong>.</p>",
  "KLM_SUBTITLE_4": "A new approach",
  "KLM_CONTENT_4": "    <p>This goal needed a <strong>new approach</strong>: performance testing should be a part of the delivery pipeline, automating execution and test result analysis as much as possible. Also performance testing should be embedded in the product teams.</p><p><strong>This is where Gatling came into the picture</strong>. <strong>Gatling is a developer friendly tool and integrates well with developer tools</strong> used at KLM, like Maven and Bamboo.</p><p>Gatling tests are written in Scala IDE's like IntelliJ or Eclipse and are added to application code base in the source repository.</p>",
  "KLM_SUBTITLE_5": "Frequent Feedback During The Sprint",
  "KLM_CONTENT_5": "<p>When running performance tests, Gatling load metrics are pushed to Graphite, together with OS and JVM metrics from the tested applications. The test results are then analyzed and benchmarked automatically, using a custom build dashboard application. The Gatling tests can be triggered from the delivery pipeline, resulting in <strong>frequent feedback on performance of an application during the sprint</strong>.</p>",
  "KLM_SUBTITLE_6": "Gatling, the standard performance test tool within KLM",
  "KLM_CONTENT_6": "<p>In the last few months all the major web applications have migrated their performance tests to Gatling, making this <strong>the de facto standard performance test tool within KLM</strong>.</p>",
  "KLM_QUOTE": "Gatling helps KLM to move from a project oriented to a <strong>continuous delivery organization</strong>.",
  "KLM_QUOTE_AUTHOR": "Senior performance test consultant @ KLM",

  "BC_TITLE": "User Story within a British Company",
  "BC_CONTENT_0": "<p>Both the Digital Load Test Team and various product teams use Gatling as a <strong>core part of our load testing effort</strong>.</p>",
  "BC_SUBTITLE_1": "Why Gatling?",
  "BC_CONTENT_1": "<p>There are <strong>three major factors</strong> that attracted us to Gatling:</p><ol><li>The HTTP DSL</li><li>The reporting</li><li>Its concurrency model</li></ol>",
  "BC_SUBTITLE_2": "HTTP DSL",
  "BC_CONTENT_2": "<p>There are a number of load-test tools that only allow tests to be written in the GUI or through XML files. <strong>We wanted test-scripts that were easily understandable</strong> and that could be committed to a version control system.</p>",
  "BC_SUBTITLE_3": "Reporting",
  "BC_CONTENT_3": "<p><strong>The interactive JavaScript reports</strong> that are produced after the test run are <strong>extremely impressive</strong> and product teams have been keen to receive the reports and analyse the results themselves.</p> <p>The <strong>integration with Graphite/InfluxDB and Grafana</strong> was also key for us as we are now able to provide <strong>real-time graphing</strong> for product teams to view during the test run.</p>",
  "BC_SUBTITLE_4": "Concurrency Model",
  "BC_CONTENT_4": "<p>With a synchronous concurrency model it is necessary to use multiple machines just to achieve several hundred requests per second. Scaling-out can be tricky to manage and costly when running from The Cloud. We have managed to achieve a <strong>high concurrency rate with Gatling using only a modest GNU/Linux box</strong>.</p>",
  "BC_SUBTITLE_5": "The Story",
  "BC_CONTENT_5": " <p>Apart from myself there are two other load-testers in the Digital Load Test Team who cover an array of application products and services. Our two main tools include Gatling and a proprietary tool.</p><p>We feel that <strong>Gatling encourages collaboration with product teams throughout the load-testing process</strong>. Firstly, performance requirements are written on a wiki, translated into a Gatling test script and then pushed to our <a href=\"https://github.com/bbc/gatling-load-tests\">Github repository</a>. Here the test is reviewed by a member of the product team. This is important because the developers do not need to install a load-test tool or wade through masses of XML in order to review the test. <strong>The DSL can be read by all</strong> and invariably changes are requested by stakeholders when a concrete test is seen.</p><p>We have created <a href=\"https://github.com/bbc/gatling-load-tests#grafanainfluxdb\">Grafana and InfluxDB Docker images</a> that can be run to receive out-of-the-box real-time graphing and metric storage. This allows both ourselves and our product teams to view the progress of the test run and use SQL like queries to retrieve data related to specific time series data.</p><p>The automatic generated reports are tarballed and uploaded to a server for stakeholders to access.</p>",
  "BC_SUBTITLE_6": "The Future",
  "BC_CONTENT_6": "<p>The general tendency towards Cloud deployments has led to a new dynamic with regards to load-testing. There has been a tendency to rely less on a centralised load-test team running on an internal infrastructure towards a model where developers and testers are spinning up instances and running load-tests themselves. Gatling is a perfect fit for this and <strong>we are starting to help product teams run Gatling as part of their Continuous Delivery pipeline</strong> utilising the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gatling+Plugin\">Gatling Jenkins plugin.</a></p>",

  "OX_TITLE": "Open-Xchange User Story",
  "OX_CONTENT_0": "<p>Open-Xchange is committed to deliver the <strong>most scalable, modern and trusted web-based collaboration and productivity solutions</strong> to the smartest companies.</p><p><strong>Our focus on multi-million user installations</strong> at the hosting and telco segment introduces a natural requirement on <strong>rigorous load and stress testing</strong>.</p><p>Using Gatling at our <strong>continuous integration workflow</strong> makes sure that regressions with regards to performance are <strong>spotted early</strong> during the development cycle.</p><p>Uncovering architectural weaknesses as soon as possible is invaluable when building complex applications.</p>",
  "OX_SUBTITLE_1": "Great flexibility, efficiency and integration",
  "OX_CONTENT_1": "<p><strong>Gatling has very quickly replaced legacy load testing tools</strong> by providing <strong>great flexibility, efficiency and integration</strong> to our existing processes and test environments.</p><p>Removing some of the <strong>bottle-necks</strong> of API load testing allowed us to achieve more comprehensive and relevan results.</p><p>Combining those benefits and improved acceptance of load testing within development teams, led to a significant increase in software quality and customer satisfaction.</p><p>At the same time, we experienced a <strong>~150x enhancement</strong> in efficiency regarding test execution, <strong>bringing down our investments on load testing dramatically.</strong></p>",
  "OX_SUBTITLE_2": "Focus on integration",
  "OX_CONTENT_2": "<p>We're using Gatling in combination with other well respected components such as <strong>Grafana, collectd, jmxtrans and InfluxDB</strong> to not only fetch and store load test data, but extract meaningful information which helps us optimizing our products.</p><p><strong>The flexibility of Gatling</strong> allowed us to adapt load testing <strong>to both open and proprietary web application protocols</strong> while using a common framework to <strong>avoid costs of re-engineering functionality or test data for other projects</strong>.</p>",
  "OX_SUBTITLE_3": "Dedicated on-site training",
  "OX_CONTENT_3": "<p>Both the community and commercial professional services offerings were extremely valuable to support the transition and continued integration of Gatling to our teams’ daily work.</p><p>The response times and quality of support from the Gatling community were exceptional.</p><p><strong>Dedicated on-site training sessions with our DevOps, Development, QA and Services staff helped to spread adoption, gaining expertise and review existing implementations.</strong></p>",
